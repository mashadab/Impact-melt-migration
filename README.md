# Rapid migration of impact melt through ocean world ices: Selk crater on Titan and Mannann’an crater on Europa

## Overview

This project investigates how impact-generated melt moves through the ice shells of ocean worlds like **Titan** and **Europa**. Traditional models only considered slow downward sinking (viscous foundering), but here we introduce **ice compaction and melt percolation through pores and fractures** alongside viscous foundering and heat transport.

Our results show that infiltration can speed up melt migration by **three orders of magnitude**, greatly enhancing the chance that surface materials reach subsurface oceans. We also propose a new dimensionless parameter — the **infiltration–foundering time ratio** — to predict whether infiltration or foundering dominates.

These findings provide more realistic estimates of post-impact material transport and habitability, with direct implications for upcoming missions such as **Europa Clipper** and **Dragonfly**.

## Getting Started

### Quick Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the required libraries, run the Matlab file for Titan and Europa corresponding to figures in the paper.
Comments are provided in the code. Output figures are located in the Figures folder.

## Melt migration with and without different motion of melt and ice phases
The following videos show the melt fraction (0 = all ice, 1 = all melt) and temperatures for the simulation outputs ran in cylindrical r-z coordinates (axisymmetric) at different time instants mentioned on the right. The inputs conditions come from iSALE outputs for Mannanan crater on Europa from Cox and Bauer (2015) and Selk crater from Wakita et. al (2023).
